Modify the following loop so it iterates 5 times instead of just once. 

iterations = 1

loop do 
  puts "Number of iterations = #{iterations}"
	break
end

=end

iterations = 1 

loop do 
	puts "Number of iterations = #{iterations}"
	iterations += 1 # iterations = iterations + 1
	break if iterations > 5
end
